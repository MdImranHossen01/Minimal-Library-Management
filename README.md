## Key Features
- **Full CRUD Operations:** Seamlessly create, read, update, and delete books from the library's collection.
- **Dynamic Inventory Management:** The system automatically decrements available copies when a book is borrowed and updates its availability status.
- **Intuitive Borrowing System:** Users can easily borrow books through a simple form, with validation to prevent over-borrowing.
- **Aggregated Borrow Summary:** A dedicated page provides a high-level summary of all borrowed books, showing which titles are most popular.
- **Responsive & Modern UI:** The frontend is built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS, offering a clean, card-based layout that works beautifully on all devices.
- **Efficient State Management:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit and RTK Query to efficiently manage API state, caching, and automatic UI updates after data mutations.
- **Robust Backend API:** The backend is built on Node.js and Express, with a modular structure and a Mongoose schema for reliable data handling with MongoDB.
